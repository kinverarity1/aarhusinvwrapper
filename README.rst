# aarhusinvwrapper

This package is a wrapper for the `AarhusInv <http://hgg.au.dk/download/inversionkernel/>`__ modelling software, to somewhat automate the process of creating models and inverting data, and so on.

It was modified from code written originally by Mike Hatch and is not associated with the Aarhus group.
